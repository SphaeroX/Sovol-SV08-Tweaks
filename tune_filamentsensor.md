## Solution

Open up the filament sensor and simply remove the brass parts, as they are unnecessary. The friction will noticeably decrease!

## Benefits

- Reduced friction in the filament path
- Smoother filament movement
- Potentially improved print quality

## Instructions

1. Carefully disassemble the filament sensor
2. Locate and remove the brass parts
3. Reassemble the sensor without the brass components
4. Test the sensor to ensure proper functionality
